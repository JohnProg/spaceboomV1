		<p>
			Account information. In order to create a Spaceboom account, you must login with Facebook. We only store your email address, your full name and your profile picture — all of which are provided by Facebook. We do not require or store any password information.
			<br>
			<br>
			Settings information. We store information pertaining to user settings.
			<br>
			<br>
			Billing information. Spaceboom does not charge users for any services, and so we do not collect and store any billing information such as a billing address or credit card information.
			<br>
			<br>
			Device information. We do not store any information about your device in our databases, but some device information is logged.
			<br>
			<br>
			Geo-location information. Precise GPS from your mobile device is collected only with your permission. However, background geo-location is necessary for using Spaceboom, and the app will not work as intended without it. While Spaceboom is running on your users’ devices (both actively and in the background), their devices routinely submit geolocation information to our servers. None of this information is stored in our databases, but some is logged. We do store some geo-location information pertaining to messages. When users submit messages, we do store the latitude and longitude of the user’s location at the time when they send the message.
			<br>
			<br>
			Message content. Messages and comments generated by users are stored on our servers.
			<br>
			<br>
			Logged information. All logged information is occasionally deleted, but not routinely.
